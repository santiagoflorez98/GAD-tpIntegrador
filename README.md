# Final Project - GAD (Gestion Avanzada de Datos / Advanced data management)
# This project was made for the subject Gestion Avanzada de Datos from the Systems Engineering career from UTN-FRCU (Universidad Tecnologica Nacional - Facultad Regional Concepcion del Urugay).
# It involves a simple UI that allows you to insert an image of the logo of a Football club and will find from a database those who are the most similar.
# This was made possible by utilizing convolutional neural networks from the PyTorch library, avaiable for the Python programming language.
# We also implemented an FHQT+ (Fixed Height Query Tree) for PostgreSQL to make it possible to run the program in a timely manner.
